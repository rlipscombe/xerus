An exploration (and alternative implementation?) of the [Squirrel Language](http://squirrel-lang.org).

- [The Language](squirrel/lang)
- The VM -- it's a [Register-based VM](squirrel/stack-or-register-based-vm)
- [Bytecode Format](squirrel/bytecode)
- [Links](squirrel/links)

The name? **Xerus** is an **african ground squirrel**.
